            <h1>About Me:</h1>
        </header>
        <p>My name is Michael Ryan, and I am currently undergoing course 201 of Code Fellows' Coding Academy.  I am a high school graduate with 2 years of college experience.  Prior to enrolling in code fellows I was attending college with the goal of acquiring a degree in architectural engineering.  Covid-19 made it difficult to continue pursuing that goal and so I decided i wanted to try something new.  I was also working as a draftsmen for a local firm up until I began my courses at Code Fellows.  Upon completeling my 401 course I will return to school to pursue a different major and acquire a bachelors degree.  I will also attempt to find a job in the field and hopefully be armed with the knowledge I need to begin working on a project of my own. </p>
